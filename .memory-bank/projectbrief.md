*Π: DEVELOPMENT | Ω: EXECUTE*

## 🏆 Overview
CursorRIPER Σ Framework GitHub Copilot Edition - Converting the original Cursor IDE framework to work with GitHub Copilot's capabilities and limitations, addressing memory bank update failures and platform compatibility.

## 📋 Requirements
- [R₁] Convert CursorRIPER Σ v1.0.5 for GitHub Copilot compatibility
- [R₂] Implement explicit memory management system
- [R₃] Update context reference system from @ to # symbols
- [R₄] Configure MCP integration for enhanced functionality
- [R₅] Create custom chat mode for GitHub Copilot
- [R₆] Maintain mathematical elegance and symbolic notation
- [R₇] Ensure all 5 RIPER modes function correctly
- [R₈] Document migration path and usage differences

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [SC₁] Memory banks update properly using explicit commands
- [SC₂] All RIPER modes transition correctly with [MODE: X] declarations
- [SC₃] Context references work with # syntax in GitHub Copilot
- [SC₄] MCP servers provide file operations successfully
- [SC₅] Custom chat mode loads and functions as expected
- [SC₆] Framework maintains original mathematical structure
- [SC₇] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [SC₈] No rate limiting issues during normal usage

## 🚧 Constraints
- [C₁] Must work within GitHub Copilot's permission system
- [C₂] Cannot rely on automatic memory updates
- [C₃] Limited to GitHub Copilot's supported context formats
- [C₄] Must handle rate limiting gracefully
- [C₅] MCP server dependencies must be clearly documented
- [C₆] Relative path requirements for cross-platform compatibility

## 🔄 Project Phases
- [Π₂] INITIALIZING: ✅ Framework conversion and setup
- [Π₃] DEVELOPMENT: 🔄 Currently building out components
- [Π₄] MAINTENANCE: 🔜 Testing and refinement phase
